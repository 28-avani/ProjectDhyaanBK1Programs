This is a short text that explains the main ideas of what we are planning to do and how much of it we have already completed.

We are planning to study several parameters related to the complexity on the meditation data set. Our objectives are to see if there is any correlation of the complexity metrics - HFD, LRTC with each other and with functional connectivity, PSD analysis.

We hope to also investigate if there are 'different' forms of meditation based on the above metrics that are investigated. If possible, we can probably conjecture and create a metric to work with.
